# Website-Project 
First Website attempt. Used html, css, js, PHP.
I did it during my database(SE2222) project in 05.01.2024

I mostly focused on **front-end** and then changed codes from **.html** to **.php** for the database.

## Can be added/changed list:
- A scroll button has to be added.
- The screen images don't work with resolution, you have to zoom out.
- The background image doesn't fit on the home page when you open it. You have to refresh the page to fit it.
- Can be added more pages, I didn't have time to add it.
- The Login to Register button works correctly but vice versa doesn't work.
